  <h1>Interruption in Soft Echo</h1>

  <p>The first time it happened, Nico was sitting in a café on Bleecker, sipping an overpriced cortado and tapping something vague but urgent into his laptop. A shadow fell across the table.</p>

  <p>He looked up.</p>

  <p>“YOU AGAIN,” the man shouted, just before tackling Nico to the tile floor.</p>

  <p>Silverware clattered. Cups smashed. Someone screamed.</p>

  <p>Then the man was gone.</p>

  <p>Nico lay on the floor, stunned, staring at the exposed foam under a ripped chair cushion. No one helped him up. The barista stepped over him to sweep broken ceramic.</p>

  <p>The second time, it was at a movie theater in Chelsea. Nico was midway through his popcorn when the man burst in from the emergency exit and body-checked him out of his seat.</p>

  <p>“YOU AGAIN,” he roared, before disappearing down the aisle.</p>

  <p>Nico sat in the aisle for ten minutes. The usher offered him a complimentary soda. He declined.</p>

  <p>It happened again on the subway. In a bookstore. At a crosswalk.</p>

  <p>Always the same man.<br>
  Always the same words.<br>
  Always vanishing before Nico could even ask why.</p>

  <p>He stopped telling people. They didn’t believe him. Or worse, they did—and started avoiding him.</p>

  <p>His sister, Sarai, called one rainy night.</p>

  <p>“Come outside. I’m in the car. We need to talk.”</p>

  <p>He climbed into the passenger seat, soaked and quiet. She stared straight ahead, hands clenched on the wheel.</p>

  <p>“You didn’t tell me,” she said. “About the man.”</p>

  <p>Nico stared. “What man?”</p>

  <p>She looked at him. “The one who keeps tackling you.”</p>

  <p>“How do you know?”</p>

  <p>“Because he’s been here before. With others. And now he’s here for you.”</p>

  <p>She pulled away from the curb.</p>

  <p>“I’m taking you to someone. They’ll explain.”</p>

  <p>They drove uptown. Rain whispered against the windshield. Nico kept touching his arm where the last collision had left a bruise.</p>

  <p>They parked near an unmarked brownstone. A brass plaque by the door read simply:</p>

  <p><strong>You Are Here.</strong></p>

  <p>“This is a joke,” Nico said.</p>

  <p>Sarai didn’t answer. She rang the bell.</p>

  <p>A receptionist opened the door. Her nametag read: <em>Marla, Probably.</em></p>

  <p>“He’s ready,” Sarai said.</p>

  <p>Marla nodded and led them down a narrow hall into a room that looked like a library had swallowed a meditation studio.</p>

  <p>A man in a kimono stood by a chalkboard covered in string diagrams and doodles of what looked like fax machines.</p>

  <p>“Welcome,” he said. “You’ve been flagged.”</p>

  <p>Nico blinked. “Flagged?”</p>

  <p>“By your higher field.”</p>

  <p>“What does that mean?”</p>

  <p>The man drew a circle. “It means part of you is trying to get your attention. And frankly, he’s not subtle.”</p>

  <p>“So... the attacks?”</p>

  <p>“Not attacks,” the man said. “Interruptions.”</p>

  <p>He drew a lightning bolt through the circle.</p>

  <p>“Your self has been stuck. Caught in predictive loops. That part of you—the one with the clarity—he’s trying to break through.”</p>

  <p>“By tackling me?”</p>

  <p>“Sometimes that’s what it takes.”</p>

  <p>Sarai rested a hand on his arm. “I know it’s crazy. But think about it. Hasn’t part of you been waiting for something exactly this weird to happen?”</p>

  <p>Nico laughed, quietly. Then louder.<br>
  Then something in him stilled.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t rage. Not really.<br>
  It was pressure. The same kind he used on himself daily—deadlines, dumbbells, calendars packed to the edges.<br>
  A voice in his head saying: <em>Earn your air.</em></p>

  <p>From behind a curtain: footsteps. Familiar. Weighted.</p>

  <p>The interrupter stepped forward—older, worn, deliberate.</p>

  <p>Now that pressure stood across from him in boots and an older face.</p>

  <p>He wasn’t sure if he was about to swing or shatter. But the charge in his arm—the one winding up into a punch—drained like water slipping out of a cracked glass.</p>

  <p>“Finally,” the man said.</p>

  <p>“Who are you?” Nico asked.</p>

  <p>The man smiled, boots planted.</p>

  <p>“I’m who you become when you stop explaining everything.”</p>

  <p>Nico stared. Then nodded, slowly.</p>

  <p>The last of the tension let go.</p>

  <p>“You again,” he said.<br>
  And this time, it didn’t hurt.</p>
