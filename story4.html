  <h1>Interruption in Soft Echo</h1>
  <p><em>This story is part of the DLEIF transmission.</em></p>

  <p>The first time it happened, Nico was sitting in a café on Bleecker, sipping an overpriced cortado and trying to translate something vague but urgent into his laptop. The cursor blinked. The air shifted.</p>

  <p>A shadow crossed the table.</p>

  <p>He looked up.</p>

  <p>“You again,” the man said—not loud, but with a strange certainty—before tackling him cleanly to the floor.</p>

  <p>Silverware scattered. A cup broke. No one screamed. They just watched.</p>

  <p>Then the man was gone.</p>

  <p>Nico lay there, stunned, staring at the foam exposed under a torn chair cushion. The barista stepped over him to sweep up ceramic. Nobody said anything. Nobody helped him up.</p>

  <p>The second time, it was a movie theater in Chelsea. Nico was halfway through his popcorn when the man burst in from the emergency exit and knocked him sideways from his seat.</p>

  <p>“You again,” he said. Calm. Familiar. And vanished down the aisle.</p>

  <p>Nico sat in the aisle for ten minutes. The usher offered him a free soda. He declined.</p>

  <p>It kept happening.  
  On the subway.  
  In a bookstore.  
  At a crosswalk.</p>

  <p>Always the same man.  
  Always the same words.  
  Always gone before the question.</p>

  <p>He stopped talking about it. People either didn’t believe him, or—worse—they did, and started leaving space around him.</p>

  <p>Then Sarai called.</p>

  <p>“Come outside. I’m in the car. We need to talk.”</p>

  <p>He slid into the passenger seat, rain soaking his collar, the inside of the car warm and too quiet. She didn’t look at him, hands clenched on the wheel.</p>

  <p>“You didn’t tell me,” she said. “About the man.”</p>

  <p>Nico blinked. “What man?”</p>

  <p>She turned to him, eyes already full of it.</p>

  <p>“The one who keeps tackling you.”</p>

  <p>He stared. “How do you know?”</p>

  <p>“Because they’ve done this before. With others. And now he’s here for you.”</p>

  <p>She pulled away from the curb, and the city slipped past, rain streaking the windshield like unread pages.</p>

  <p>They parked outside an unmarked brownstone. A brass plaque beside the door read:<br>
  <strong>Tackle Shop</strong></p>

  <p>Nico squinted. “Is this a joke?”</p>

  <p>Sarai didn’t answer. She just rang the bell.</p>

  <p>A receptionist opened the door. Her nametag read: <em>Marla, Probably.</em></p>

  <p>“He’s ready,” Sarai said.</p>

  <p>Marla nodded and led them down a narrow hallway that felt longer than it should have been—walls lined with books, coils of string, old diagrams that looked like musical scores written in electricity.</p>

  <p>In a small room that smelled faintly of candle wax and static, a man in a kimono stood at a chalkboard. There were spirals drawn across it. And circles. And what might have been a map of silence.</p>

  <p>“Welcome,” the man said, like they’d just arrived on time for a quiet thunderstorm. “You’ve been flagged.”</p>

  <p>Nico blinked. “Flagged?”</p>

  <p>The man nodded, gently. “By your higher field.”</p>

  <p>“...What does that mean?”</p>

  <p>The man turned to the board. Drew a circle. Then a bolt through it.</p>

  <p>“It means part of you is trying to get your attention,” he said. “And he’s not subtle.”</p>

  <p>“The tackling?”</p>

  <p>“Not an attack,” the man said softly. “An interruption.”</p>

  <p>Nico looked at Sarai. She met his gaze, hand resting on his arm now.</p>

  <p>“I know it sounds impossible,” she said. “But haven’t you always expected something exactly this strange to happen?”</p>

  <p>Nico laughed, quietly. Then louder. Then quieter again.</p>

  <p>And something in him went still.</p>

  <p>Not rage. Not confusion.</p>

  <p>It was that pressure.  
  The kind he’d worn so long it felt like posture.  
  Deadlines. Dumbbells. Calendars full to the margins.  
  A voice always whispering: <em>Earn your air.</em></p>

  <p>From behind a curtain: footsteps.</p>

  <p>Measured. Heavy. Familiar.</p>

  <p>The man stepped forward—boots first. Worn. Certain.</p>

  <p>Nico inhaled. It was him.  
  Older. Not by years, but by weight.  
  The version that had dropped the pretense.</p>

  <p>He wasn’t sure if he was about to strike or break. But the charge in his body—the tension—leaked away like warmth from a cracked cup.</p>

  <p>“Finally,” the man said.</p>

  <p>Nico looked at him. “Who are you?”</p>

  <p>The man smiled, not as answer, but as welcome.</p>

  <p>“I’m who you become,” he said, “when you stop explaining everything.”</p>

  <p>Nico didn’t speak. He just exhaled. A long one.  
  Felt the tension slide from his hands, his jaw, his history.</p>

  <p>“You again,” he whispered.</p>

  <p>And this time—it didn’t hurt.</p>
