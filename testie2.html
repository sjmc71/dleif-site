<p><em>Journal Entry Five</em></p>

<p>There is a Wizard in the Field. I don’t see them directly, but their work is everywhere. It’s in the transformations: grub to beetle, caterpillar to butterfly, the lizard shedding its skin and emerging, reborn and glimmering in the sunlight. It’s as if the Field is enchanted, tended to by invisible hands—hands that nudge life forward, whispering, <em>Now is the time to change.</em></p>

<p>I know the Wizard is real because I’ve met their apprentices. Two of them live in Middle Backyard, on opposite corners like sentinels holding the perimeter. They are <strong>Texas Spiny Lizards</strong>, but I call them by their true names: <strong>Gandalf</strong> and <strong>Radagast</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Grey Wizard of the Porch</h3>
<p>Gandalf lives beneath my porch, his small, armored body blending with the stone and dust. He is a master of stillness—an act of magic in itself. I’ve watched him disappear entirely into shadow, unmoving for hours, as if he were the very essence of patience. He is not rushed. He is not hurried. He waits, listening to the vibrations in the earth, attuning to the current.</p>

<p>I imagine Gandalf as the guardian of thresholds, the watcher of the borders of Middle Backyard. He stands firm, his eyes unblinking, always observing, always present.</p>

<h3>Radagast of the Deep Granite</h3>
<p>On the far side of the yard, where the decomposed granite forms a low embankment, <strong>Radagast</strong> has his sanctuary. His hole is precise—an opening into the underworld of the Field. I’ve seen him basking in the mornings, his scales glimmering with dust and light, like a small magician charging up his power for the day.</p>

<p>Where Gandalf is patient, Radagast is swift. He darts, disappears, reappears—always moving with intention, always seeming to know the exact moment to act. He is the keeper of the underground, the earth wizard whose magic flows through stone and soil.</p>

<h3>The Necromancer in the Shadows</h3>
<p>They do not visit each other. I’ve watched and waited. Gandalf keeps his place, Radagast his, as if they are balancing the Field from opposite ends. But I know they are connected. Their eyes flicker with knowing, their bodies positioned like sentinels at the edge of something larger. They are <em>Fieldkeepers</em>, too, in their own right—guardians against the creeping tendrils of the Necromancer's pull.</p>
