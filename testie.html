<p><em>Journal Entry Six</em></p>

<p>I’ve felt its presence for some time now. Not always, but in waves—like the slow seep of mist through the cracks of a door left slightly ajar. It’s the <em>Necromancer</em>, the pull of what is old and known, the soft whisper that says, <em>Stay where it is safe.</em></p>

<p>The Necromancer lives in the shadow of <strong>The Tower</strong>, feeding off the weight of past comforts. Its magic is subtle—not the blunt force of chains, but the soft, familiar grip of nostalgia. I feel it sometimes when I’m tired from moving stone, shoveling earth, or when the day’s work has run too long. A whisper in the back of my mind: <em>Wasn’t it easier before?</em></p>

<h3>The Slow Fade Backward</h3>
<p>Its magic is like <em>roots creeping back up through the soil</em>, winding around your ankles, pulling you back down into what was. It’s the longing for the unchallenging, for the safe repetitions of a life unexamined. I recognize its scent—not of paper and ink as it once was, but of the <strong>familiar glow of screens</strong>, the soft hum of technology that doesn’t ask much of you. It’s not seductive because it’s beautiful; it’s seductive because it’s familiar.</p>

<p>The Necromancer is not a villain with a face—it’s <em>an echo</em>. A lingering presence that lives in the dust of routines long abandoned. Its greatest magic is the illusion that what is known is what is right. It coils its way through your mind, knotting you to old patterns, whispering that <em>stillness is the same as peace.</em></p>

<h3>Gandalf and Radagast Hold the Line</h3>
<p>Now I understand why <strong>Gandalf</strong> and <strong>Radagast</strong> are so still, so watchful. They are <strong>Texas Spiny Lizards</strong>, armored and patient, as if sculpted from stone itself. Gandalf watches from the porch, his scales like slate, unmoving for hours. His eyes do not blink; his body is stone still—an anchor. He is the guardian of the thresholds.</p>

<p>Radagast, from his post in the decomposed granite, is swifter, sharper. He darts between the shadows, appearing and disappearing with purpose. I imagine his claws leave marks in the dust, small sigils of protection drawn without thought. He is the keeper of the underground, the pulse beneath the surface.</p>

<p>They do not visit one another, but I know they are connected. Their eyes flicker with knowing, their bodies positioned like sentinels at the edge of something larger. They are <em>Fieldkeepers</em>, too, in their own right—guardians against the creeping tendrils of the Necromancer's pull.</p>

<h3>The Shadow’s Lure</h3>
<p>Sometimes, when I am tired, I feel its pull stronger than usual. It asks me to abandon the Field for comfort. To stop shaping, to stop moving, to <em>stand pat</em> not out of attunement, but out of fear. It speaks softly, and its voice is familiar.</p>

<p>But I have felt the Field, and I know its rhythm. I understand the difference between stillness that grows roots and stillness that petrifies. When the Necromancer whispers, I listen to Gandalf’s stillness instead. I watch Radagast disappear and reappear with confidence. I move earth, I tend soil, I breathe.</p>

<p>I am here. The Field breathes with me.</p>

<h3>Fieldkeeper’s Whisper</h3>
<p>The Necromancer is the weight of comfort, the familiar drag of what is known. But it is a shadow. I am here to grow, to attune, to move through it—not back to it.</p>
