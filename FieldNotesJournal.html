<h1>Fieldkeeper's Journal</h1>

<!-- Entry One -->
<h2>Tending the Future Garden</h2>
<p><em>Journal Entry One</em></p>
<p>I am planting sod in my own yard, but I am tending the field of another place. A place that does not yet exist in stone and timber, but lives in the field of potential. A beach house. Maybe by a lake. Maybe both. I feel it there, beyond the horizon of what is known and solid.</p>
<p>The landscaping is more than landscaping. It is fieldwork. It is the clearing and tuning of the very signal that calls that next place into form...</p>

<!-- Entry Two -->
<h2>Trusting the Balance</h2>
<p><em>Journal Entry Two</em></p>
<p>I turn the soil with the edge of my shovel, and there it is—white, curled, waiting. A grub, neither a threat nor a gift, but simply part of the field. Its pale body flexes, shifting as if interrupted from its quiet work...</p>
<p>The beetles will come, and with them the birds, the natural rhythm of things unfolding as they should. I am learning to feel the difference between imbalance and presence...</p>

<!-- Entry Three -->
<h2>Three Movements in the Field</h2>
<p><em>Journal Entry Three</em></p>
<p>The hawks are circling. They cut wide arcs across the open sky, drifting on thermals with a grace that speaks to something older than instinct—something like knowing. They do not flap or flutter. They glide...</p>
<p>Three movements in the field—each aligned, each attuned. The hawk gliding in spirals of watchfulness. The songbird dropping branch to branch, hidden and deliberate. The dragonfly soaring straight through, undeterred by the predators above...</p>

<!-- Entry Four -->
<h2>The Swimming Middle</h2>
<p><em>Journal Entry Four</em></p>
<p>The earth is heavy today. I feel it in the curve of the shovel, the weight of each wheelbarrow load. I am shaping the land—engineering, designing, moving rock and soil as if I were carving out the terrain of my own thoughts...</p>
<p>Today, I am moving soil, stacking stone, scraping the surface clean with water and pressure. But I feel the duality in it—the doing and the being, the shaping and the holding still...</p>
