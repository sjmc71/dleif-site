<h1>Mythic Field Dispatches</h1>
<p><em>Whispers and Wonders from the Field</em></p>

<!-- Dispatch One -->
<h2 id="the-wizard-in-the-field">The Wizard in the Field</h2>
<p><em>A whisper in the soil, a ripple in the leaves.</em></p>

<p>There is a Wizard in the Field. I don’t see them directly, but their work is everywhere. It’s in the transformations: grub to beetle, caterpillar to butterfly, the lizard shedding its skin and emerging, reborn and glimmering in the sunlight. It’s as if the Field is enchanted, tended to by invisible hands—hands that nudge life forward, whispering, <em>Now is the time to change.</em></p>

<p>I know the Wizard is real because I’ve met their apprentices. Two of them live in Middle Backyard, on opposite corners like sentinels holding the perimeter. They are <strong>Texas Spiny Lizards</strong>, but I call them by their true names: <strong>Gandalf</strong> and <strong>Radagast</strong>.</p>

<p>Gandalf lives beneath my porch, armored and still. He is not rushed. He is not hurried. He waits, listening to the vibrations in the earth, attuning to the current. Radagast, swift and sharp, moves through the decomposed granite with purpose. They do not visit each other, but I know they are connected. Guardians of the unseen paths. Fieldkeepers in their own right.</p>

<p>When I watch them, I understand the stillness of magic. I understand that movement and patience are two sides of the same whisper.</p>

<!-- Dispatch Two -->
<h2 id="the-necromancer-in-the-shadows">The Necromancer in the Shadows</h2>
<p><em>The slow creep of nostalgia, the weight of old comforts.</em></p>

<p>I’ve felt its presence for some time now. Not always, but in waves—like the slow seep of mist through the cracks of a door left slightly ajar. It’s the <em>Necromancer</em>, the pull of what is old and known, the soft whisper that says, <em>Stay where it is safe.</em></p>

<p>Its magic is subtle—not the blunt force of chains, but the soft, familiar grip of nostalgia. It roots itself in the old pathways, the grooves worn deep from repetition. It whispers in the voice of comfort, of stillness that leads to petrification. But I know its name now, and I see its reach.</p>

<p>When it creeps, Gandalf watches. Radagast moves. The perimeter is held. The Field breathes on.</p>
